# GXO Signify Forecasting Solution

## Business Requirements Document (BRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** June 26, 2025  
**Prepared by:** 1CloudHub  
**Project:** GXO Forecasting Enablement - Signify Pilot  

---

## Executive Summary

### Business Context

GXO Logistics currently provides warehousing and fulfillment services for Signify across Thailand and Singapore operations. While physical operations are efficiently managed through EDI integrations, **operational visibility is limited to 1-3 days**, constraining proactive planning capabilities and positioning GXO as an execution-only partner rather than a strategic logistics advisor.

### Strategic Opportunity

This pilot project will establish GXO's **Forecasting-as-a-Service** capability, transforming the relationship from reactive logistics execution to proactive, data-driven partnership. Success with Signify becomes the foundation for a scalable, multi-client forecasting platform.

### Business Objectives

1. **Immediate Value:** Improve operational efficiency through 1-4 week forecasting visibility
2. **Strategic Positioning:** Establish GXO as a data-driven planning partner, not just executor
3. **Platform Foundation:** Create scalable forecasting capability for future client expansion
4. **Commercial Opportunity:** Develop new revenue streams through premium analytics services

## Business Problems & Solutions

| **Current Problem** | **Business Impact** | **Solution Approach** |
|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Limited Planning Horizon** | Reactive workforce scheduling, suboptimal truck utilization | SKU-level forecasting with 1-4 week visibility |
| **Forecasting Ownership Gap** | GXO positioned as executor-only, limited strategic value | GXO-owned operational forecasting capability |
| **Inefficient Resource Allocation** | 15-20% cost premium due to emergency staffing/shipping | Proactive capacity planning and optimization |
| **Missed Strategic Opportunities** | Limited ability to influence upstream decisions or offer value-added services | Data-driven insights and strategic recommendations |
